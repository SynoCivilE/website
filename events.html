                                <p>Treasure Hunt is yet another online event testing your knowledge about the civil engineering field. The task was to answer the questions given in the PDF document, figure out a code using it and use that code to open the next PDF. This way, the team that solves all the problems in the least amount of time wins. This was the second edition of the event, the first being conducted the previous year.</p>
