                        <p>As We have used GFRG Panels (Glass Fiber Reinforced Concrete) for construction of residential buildings, which results in signiﬁcant increase in the construction speed, reduction in the labour requirement & construction cost and promotion of reuse of waste industrial by-product. Also, the light- weight property of GFRG panels makes it appropriate for using it in higher seismic zones. We designed GFRG panels from calcined gypsum, plaster, reinforced with glass ﬁbres and ﬁxed it’s physical dimensions as thickness of 124mm under carefully controlled conditions to a length of 12m and height of 3m, contains cavities of 94 mm x 230 mm that may be unﬁlled, partially ﬁlled or fully ﬁlled with reinforced concrete as per structural requirement. The whole building, made out of concrete in ﬁlled GFRG panels, avoids the use of bricks (with multiple joints and weak locations) and reduces the use of concrete signiﬁcantly and gives excellent surface ﬁnish which eliminates the need for plastering. Durability is also the same as conventional buildings. Housing using GFRG has great potential and is an ideal solution for mass housing which can be rapidly built which addresses sustainability and delivers quality houses.

                        <blockquote class="blog-item">It was a surprise for me to see that even though UCWL is a technical industry, still it’s employees and interns here celebrated environment day by making short videos, participating in debate, poetry recitation, doing yoga early in the morning on yoga day and also actively participating in campaigns like blood donation camp. Though I was able to learn and interact well with the civil department present at the UCWL plant I found that compared to civil, there were more learning opportunities for the students in chemical, mechanical, electrical and CSE discipline for technical aspects. </blockquote>
