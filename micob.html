                        <p>MiCoB is an entrepreneurial venture initiated by four research stu- dents at IIT Gandhinagar. With the motto to merge art, automation and construction, MiCoB strives to change the face of construction industry, and how it is perceived in general. The company focusses on bringing man-machine integration in the construction segment, using its state of the art 3D concrete printing technology. 3D concrete printing is a novel method which uses fully automated concrete extru- sion assembly to perform layer- wise construction of large scale segments.<br><br>

                        The process results in quality-compliant end products with better con- trol over the rheology and finish of the material. Further, 3D concrete printing is more sustain- able and eco-f riendly as it produces 40% less carbon foot print com- pared to the convention- al methods. Besides, the major commercial chal- lenges associated with conventional construc- tion such as cost and time are also effectively addressed using this technology.
                            
                        </p>

                        <blockquote class="blog-item">We expect that with that the 3D printing technology developed at MiCoB, construction of mass housing could be made faster, safer, more economic, less labour intensive and environment friendly. The company also look forward to cater the need of customised, flexible and rapid construction of various inf rastructural elements that could contribute in the projects such as metro rails, flyovers and smart city development.</blockquote>

                        <p>Another exciting market segment that MiCoB is successfully targeting is that of concrete furniture. With its exceptional designs and customisation, MiCoB’s concrete furniture is an excellent choice for the modern décor. Long term durability, near-zero maintenance and the unique look of our concrete furniture has the potential to change the face of modern furniture and home décors in coming times. Other salient features of our furniture include its low maintenance, no swelling, and resistance to heat, extreme weather conditions, microbial attacks and termites.<br><br>

                        With the vision to improve the current scenario of architecture, infrastructure and real estate , MiCoB looks forward to offer design f reedom, streamlined construction processes, economic habitats to all and sustainable inf rastructure; while also making the due contribution in safeguarding the environment. In a nutshell, we at MiCoB aims to be a part of the society that thrives to create a better world for the upcoming generation.
